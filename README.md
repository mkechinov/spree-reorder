SpreeReorder
============

This is just a simple extension to add a "Reorder" button to the Orders show view. When a user presses it, all of the line items from the past order are added to his/her cart so he/she can start the checkout process.

To install, just add this to your Gemfile:

    gem 'spree_reorder', github: "chumakoff/spree-reorder", branch: '2-1-stable'


I'll add more functionality as needed, but this mainly was an experiment to play with writing a Spree extension.
